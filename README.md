# ATLAS Equipment Centre

[ATLAS Equipment Centre API](https://sensorsystems.iais.fraunhofer.de/doc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlasH2020/atlas-equipment-centre/master/oas)  

Even though the ATLAS Equipment Centre is not an ATLAS service in the strictest sense of the term, you can still pair with it and retrieve the information needed to connect with it via the ATLAS Registry public endpoints:
- https://sensorsystems.iais.fraunhofer.de/api/services/equipment_centre
- https://sensorsystems.iais.fraunhofer.de/api/services/equipment_centre/api
- https://sensorsystems.iais.fraunhofer.de/api/services/equipment_centre/pairing

Since the ATLAS Equipment Centre supports proxy authentication via ATLAS, you can use your existing ATLAS Participant Portal credentials (client id/secret) to access the ATLAS Equipment Centre API as well (but not the same token).

The user accounts to the ATLAS Equipment Centre are meant for end-users (e.g. farmers), therefore, ATLAS Participant Portal login/password are not suitable. Please contact the ATLAS Administrators to obtain an ATLAS Equipment Centre account.
